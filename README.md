Project description:

LogiGate platform is a system which enables users from all around the globe to try a new logic gates simmulator designed for
Computer Architecture basics.

We would like to try and improve the level of solutions and the efficiency in logical problems and expend people's knowledge.

We give access to people who does not necessarily know Hebrew and we try to provide them with high level subtitles and expanding the
user usage.

We also want to make the platform more accessible for Exact Sciences degrees, and to improve their curriculum fields.

The project's goal is to break out with new head on versions that would be able to represent the system and describe our goals
correctly.
